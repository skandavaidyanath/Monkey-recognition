# Monkey-recognition
Using Convolutional Neural Networks for a multi-class image classification problem of classifying monkeys into ten different species  
The repository contains:
1) app.py : The code for the CNN
2) Training data
3) Test data
4) The actual trained model (test set accuracy around 75%)
5) A couple of test images.

Based on Keras implementation, Tensorflow backend
